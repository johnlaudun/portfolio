## Teaching

### University of Louisiana at Lafayette

**English 332: Introduction to Folklore**. This iteration of the Introduction to Folklore course is focused on folk narrative. Participants in the course will encounter diverse definitions of and theories about narrative, examine various forms of narrative (with a focus on traditional genres of folklore), collect and document instances of folk narrative, and produce an analytical research report on those materials. Participants in this course will learn how to read scholarly and scientific definitions and analyses of human nature with a special emphasis on narrative and then apply those definitions or reproduce such analyses in their own thinking and writing. Writing is a significant component of any communication, be it scientific or professional, and participants in this course will be required to assume those voices necessary to accomplishing a particular task. In addition, as a course in folklore studies participants will also create documentation containing both metadata and data in appropriate markup, which may or may not include things like XML.

**English 334: Digital Folklore and Culture**. Memes, fake news, trolling, rickrolling are all well-established forms of internet behavior and are as much a part of our everyday lives as grandma’s gumbo. English 334 explores the varieties and depths of digital cultures, from the first email forwards to the latest tiktoks and everything in between. Course activities include curating collections of multimedia materials; learning how to parse digital content; annotating, sorting, and compiling data sets; applying appropriate analytical frameworks; and exploring ways to present your ideas effectively. The course includes producing an online portfolio and learning collaborative and versioning systems to make it possible to work with others as well as secure your own work.

**English 335: Louisiana Folklore**. Someone once called Louisiana a "folklore land" and we do live in a state, and in a region of the state, where folklore not only abides in abundance but is the subject of a great deal of attention by scholars and citizens, tourists and natives. This course encourages students to take a closer look for themselves at the folklore that surrounds each of us, at the various ways it has been and is currently being represented, and at the ways that it is used to create our everyday reality. Taking a closer look requires students to go out and "see" for themselves various aspects of Louisiana folklife, and then transforming that research into writing that will be shared with others. As part of learning how to write about folk culture, the course includes a survey of literature about Louisiana.

**English 432: American Folklore**. With the rise of social media and the diversification of information channels, there also came a comcomitant rise in alternative points of view, fake news, and even "alt facts." Much of the establishment seemed surprised, but for folklorists this was little more than an expansion and throttling up of the legend conduit. Sometimes dismissed as little more than "urban myths," legends are a powerful form of communication (and community-building), and the focus of thi course. We will begin with classical legends and their study, work our way through the rise of urban legends, and then proceed to examine the complex mix of legendry and legend-like material that is pervasive on the internet and among us. As an advanced course for undergraduates and a foundational course for graduate students, this course attempts to address folk materials, and dynamics in terms of rhetorical effectiveness, literary/generic structure, and cultural history. Some students will be interested in the theory that will be used throughout the course, and non-folklorists interested in American literature and culture will find the historical dimensions critical to understanding certain genres/topics of American fiction.

**English 482: Folklore Genres**. Each and everyday we get up and participate in a combined reality that we negotiate through a shared set of conventions -- even how we individuate ourselves is based on something we have in common. Most of these conventions are not written down anywhere nor are they taught in school, and yet somehow we know them: we know what to do and what not to do. This course examines these ways of talking and ways of doing upon which we depend. We will, of course, spend a fair amount of our time focused on ways of talking, but we will also examine other forms of socialization and social interaction: games, houses, food, among others. This course requires an independent research project on a topic of the student's choosing, which will be shared with others. As an advanced course for undergraduates and a foundational course for graduate students, this course attempts to address folk materials, and dynamics in terms of rhetorical effectiveness, literary/generic structure, and cultural history. Some students will be interested in the theory that will be used, albeit lightly, throughout the course, and non-folklorists interested in American literature and culture will find the historical dimensions critical to understanding certain genres/topics of American fiction.

**English 531:. The Study of Narrative**. Stories feature prominently in our lives and in discourses about our lives. Children ask parents to tell them a story; we swap stories as adults in order to get to know each other; and, increasingly, doctors and lawyers describe the work they do in terms of stories. This seminar is designed to familiarize participants with the wide range of scholarship and science that treats stories. Our goal will be to refine our own working definition of narrative both to understand its nature but also, for those interested in creative projects, to refine our practice. It should be clear from this description that this seminar is open to a wide range of interests: creative, literary, folkloristic, rhetorical, and linguistic.

**English 632: Proseminar in Folklore Theory**. This course is a survey of key concepts, problems, and perspectives in folklore theory and method, focusing on key moments, ideas, and texts in the evolution of folklore studies in order to acquire a "feel" for the foundations of the discipline. For the purposes of this course, the field is conceived fairly broadly and includes work done in adjacent fields like anthropology, sociology, psychology, linguistics, and literary studies. As much as it is possible, the readings are chronological, allowing participants to follow the interactive dimensions of intellectual history, wherein one theory arises as a response to (extension of, corrective of, or refutation of) another theory. Mileage in such a chronology must vary, however, as some texts (usually those that awaited translation) are considered in the context of those texts they most influenced.
