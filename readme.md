# John Laudun: Portfolio

Academics and researchers produce a lot of material. While its inherent interest varies, the need to collect it -- either for the sake of sharing, for the sake of a vita, or because the producer is forgetful -- remains constant. After a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, I have settled upon a GitHub repository for all these materials, both because it centralizes things on my local computer and because it centralizes things on the internet. 

Not everything here is fully accessible: in addition to plain text files, usually written in markdown, and PDFs, there are plenty of Word, Pages, and Keynote documents. Part of my goal in centralizing these things is, once collected, to embark upon a thorough converting of all the documents to open, accessible formats. 

The [Table of Contents](toc.md) is, for now, simply a copy and pasted version of my vita, taken from my [website][]. (The website has varied a great deal in its focus over the years, but it is now largely focused on working concerns.)
