# John Laudun

Academics and researchers produce a lot of material. While its inherent interest varies, the need to collect it -- either for the sake of sharing, for the sake of a vita, or because the producer is forgetful -- remains constant. After a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, I have settled upon a GitHub repository for all these materials, both because it centralizes things on my local computer and because it centralizes things on the internet. 

Not everything here is fully accessible: in addition to plain text files, usually written in markdown, and PDFs, there are plenty of Word, Pages, and Keynote documents. Part of my goal in centralizing these things is, once collected, to embark upon a thorough converting of all the documents to open, accessible formats. 

This portfolio is a companion to a [website](https://johnlaudun.net/) I have maintained since 2006, which seems like ages ago. It began as a simple blog and has morphed into any number of things over the decade and a half since its inception. I make no apologies for its lumpy nature: I am fairly certain that, seen from a distance, life itself is rather lumpy.

## Contents

Academic vitae are long. To make it easier to jump to sections that might interest someone, the following quick links are below with the fuller outline below that. Please note that links to publications in the vita are to the published materials and links in the outline of contents may be to galleys or earlier drafts. Wherever possible, please cite the published version. (If you are a scholar who does not have access to these versions, please contact me and I will find a way to get materials to you.)
